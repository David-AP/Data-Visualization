### Author: David √Ålvarez Palacios

Based on the population country and year we got on the first nvd3 sample (1960 - 2016 all countries in the world), create a world map chart and combo to pick the year and display data as a plus create an animated version, transitioning from 1960 to 2016.

Alternative, propose an advance map scenario (spain or europe), and use other data source (please do not just copy paste a single sample, in that case we will request additional custom steps).

**IMPORTANT**
* Create the project in Github.
* Include the link to the Github report.
* This github report must have a readme.md explaining the goal of the project and how to start it.
